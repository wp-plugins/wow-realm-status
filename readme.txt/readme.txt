A widget for displaying the status of any World of Warcraft US Realm.

== Description ==

Add the widget to your sidebar.  Set the title to whatever you want
the header of the widget to say, and set the realm name to the
desired name of a US World of Warcraft realm.

== Installation ==

Drop the wow-realm-status folder (or even wow-realm-status.php) into /wp-content/plugins/ and activate the plug in the Wordpress admin area.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this support multiple realms =

No.  Not yet, anyway.  When I get around to it I plan on adding support for displaying the status of multiple realms.

= Why no WoW-Europe support? =

I created this plugin in under an hour and do not currently have the time to add support for WoW Europe realms.  This is something I'd like to add, though.
