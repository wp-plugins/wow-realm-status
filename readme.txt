A widget for displaying the status of any World of Warcraft US Realm.

== Description ==

This plugin creates a widget that you can use in a sidebar to display the current status of any US World of Warcraft realm.  After looking around for an already existing plugin I realized nobody had created one yet and decided to do it myself.  This is my first WP plugin and I hope you enjoy!  Feel free to contact me with any questions, comments, etc.

* Usage: Add the widget to your sidebar.  Set the Title to whatever you want the header of the widget to say, and set the Realm Name to the desired name of a US World of Warcraft realm.

== Installation ==

Drop the wow-realm-status folder (or even wow-realm-status.php) into /wp-content/plugins/ and activate the plug in the Wordpress admin area.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this support multiple realms? =

No.  Not yet, anyway.  When I get around to it I plan on adding support for displaying the status of multiple realms.

= Why no WoW-Europe support? =

I created this plugin in under an hour and do not currently have the time to add support for WoW Europe realms.  This is something I'd like to add, though.
